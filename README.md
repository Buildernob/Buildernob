- 👋 Hi, I’m @Buildernob
- 👀 I’m interested in building, playing in servers, talking to friednds, meeting new people in the community, and making new things. I also have a Discord server that I've been working on for a while too!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to find out how to do coding. I don't know how, but this might be a good start for learning. :)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on smaller coding projects that I can learn off of because I'm newer to coding and I'm not used to larger projects.
- 📫 How to reach me. Just send me a message on Discord if you have it. My Discord account username is Buildernoob#1234. To anyone that does message me, please tell me that you came from Github and I will try to repond when I can.

<!---
Buildernoob is just a noob that plays Minecraft and is just trying to learn more things from the community!
